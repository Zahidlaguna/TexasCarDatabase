# Texas Car sales database 

This is a Mysql project that uses vehicle inventory data from texas dealerships and tracks them by sales, services, and whether or not the vehicle is sold or still in stock.
The database uses triggers and procedures to make changes when something has happened to a vehicle or it has been sold.
